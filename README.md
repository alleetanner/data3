# data-vis-with-streamlit

This repository holds the source markdown files, and resulting HTML files for the course Data Visualisation with Streamlit, as delivered by the Research Software Engineering team at the University of Bristol.

The editable markdown files are in `graphical-data-apps/site-build/content` and `graphical-data-apps/site-build/content/posts`. Any pushes to master will trigger the Github Action `.github/workflow/push-deploy.yml` (Hugo build and deploy site - takes a couple of minutes, cache refresh might be needed to see changes).

The file and folder structure here relates to assets created by Hugo (the style template), as run in the GitHub actions workflow.

[Here](https://gist.github.com/alleetanner/a0397fb4dd1a0615dc0d0035fb36515a) is a reminder to self of how to get things working from scratch, if making a similar repo.
