### University of Bristol âˆ™ Research Computing Training

*Welcome to this workshop on Graphical Data Apps in Python. These pages can be followed in your own time, but also guide our training workshop.*

**Data apps** are interactive interfaces for visualisation, communication and collaboration in data science. In this course we use a pure [Python](https://www.python.org/) approach to app development, building on our other [Python training](https://milliams.com/courses/).
