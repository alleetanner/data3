*Welcome to this workshop on data visualisation using Streamlit. These pages can be followed in your own time, but also guide our training workshop.*

As researchers and learners, want often to work with data, interpret through visualisation, and communicate our findings with others. One way to do this is by creating web-apps or data-apps - web pages providing an accessible user interface for otherwise-complex data processing and visualisation. Typically, creating such pages demands knowledge of JavaScript, HTML and CSS - languages that can be challenging, and are not widely-used in research workflows. 

Streamlit addresses these issues by providing a pure Python approach to building data-apps. Streamlit also interfaces with cloud services, bypassing complications usually associated with publishing web pages, such as managing hosts, servers, domains and traffic. As such, we can focus on making beautiful and meaningful data-apps, while Streamlit handles the internet side of things!
