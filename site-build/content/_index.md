*Welcome to this workshop on data visualisation using Streamlit. These pages can be followed in your own time, but also guide our training workshop.*

As researchers and learners, want often to work with data, interpret through visualisation, and communicate our findings with others. One way to do this is by creating web-apps or data-apps - web pages providing an accessible user interface for otherwise-complex data processing and visualisation. Typically, creating such pages demands a skillset including HTML, JavaScript and CSS - languages that have a high technical overhead, continue to rapidly develop, and are not prevalent in research workflows. 

Streamlit addresses these issues by providing a pure Python approach to building data-apps. Streamlit also interfaces with GitHub and cloud services, to simplify deploying web-pages, bypassing complications usually associated with administering a web page, such as managing hosts, servers, domains and traffic. As such, we can focus on data, visualisation, and communication, while Streamlit handles the internet side of things.
