### University of Bristol âˆ™ Research Computing Training

*Welcome to this workshop on Graphical Data Apps in Python. These pages can be followed in your own time, but also guide our training workshop.*

Researchers and students often work with data, interpret through visualisation, and communicate findings with others. **Data apps** are an ideal medium for this: a data app can be shared so others can work on data in a browser-hosted interface. Or, if you are ready for the wider world, you can deploy your app as a public web page, no specialist skills required!

In this course we use the [Python](https://www.python.org/) data app library [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) to build a data app. Streamlit can also interface with [cloud services](https://streamlit.io/cloud), bypassing complications usually associated with publishing web pages. As such, we can **focus on making beautiful and useful data apps, while Python handles the interface and internet side of things!**

By the end of this workshop, you will
- Be familiar with the [`Streamlit`](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference) library, and where to find development resources 
- Know the basics of layout and visualisation
- Have some practice with the [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html) dataframe
- Have an introduction to the plotting library [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/)
- Be able to deploy your Streamlit data-app to the internet
