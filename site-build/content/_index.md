### University of Bristol âˆ™ Research Computing Training

*Welcome to this workshop on Graphical Data Apps in Python. These pages can be followed in your own time, but also guide our training workshop.*

**Data apps** are interactive interfaces for visualisation, communication and collaboration in data science.

In this course we use a pure [Python](https://www.python.org/) approach to creating data apps - enabling you to focus on making beautiful and useful data apps, while Python handles the interface and internet side of things!
