### What are data apps?
An app (short for "application") is a computer program that provides an interface that allows users to input commands, and for the results of those commands to be displayed back to the user. Of course, that essentially covers nearly all computer programs, but today the word "app" often refers to a program focussed on a particular task.

Web apps are programs that can be accessed through a web browser, designed to work smoothly on both desktop computers and mobile devices. A data app is a type of web app that is designed to work with data, in particular to offer visualisations.

Until recently, data apps and visualisations have usually required good knowledge of the core web programming languages - HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These languages, however, are not commonly used in academia or education, because they are not designed for computation or data-processing. However, there are libraries available to bridge this gap between the "back end" (raw code that manages and processes data) and the "front end" (the user interface, designed to be used without requiring technical skills).

In Python, a popular library for data app development is [Streamlit](). This is a library which aims to make generating data apps as streamlined as possible - and includes easy ways to deploy (publish to the internet) your app. Streamlit also integrates with some popular Python data visualisation libraries. Altogether, this means we can build good-looking, user-friendly dashboards, in pure Python!
