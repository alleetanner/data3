{{< admonition type="info" title="Expected experience" open=false >}}
To get the most out of this course, learners should:
- be comfortable with writing Python at an intermediate level, for example with an understanding of functions, arguments and imports
- have at least a basic knowledge of the [Pandas Dataframe](https://realpython.com/lessons/introduction-pandas-dataframe/)
- have [Anaconda Navigator](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) installed, so you can run a Jupyter Lab session in your browser
- have experience of working in Jupyter Lab (or another IDE).

{{< admonition type="info" title="Set up" open=true >}}
Before we begin, we will need a couple of files:
- the [environment.yml]() file; this will update Python running in Anaconda so that we have all the dependencies that we need
- the [dataset]() that we will be working with

Start Anaconda Navigator. We are going to create a new "environment". This of this as creating a new, custom version of Python, where we will install additional functionality specific for the project we are working on. (We recommend creating a new environment for every project, as this lessens chances of conflicts, and prevents your "base" install of Python becoming overly-burdened with libraries that you don't need.)

In Anaconda Navigator's start screen, select "Environments" from the menu on the left. Now, at the bottom of the window, click "Import", and select the `environment.yml` file that you downloaded. Name this new environment `data-apps`, then click to continue. Anaconda will now check that everything is in place, and install the dependencies. This can take a few minutes, so please be patient!

Once it is complete, you will see in the the Environments menu that `data-apps` now exists (probably below `base (root)`, which is your default Python install for Anaconda). Select `data-apps` (if it isn't already), and return to the "Home" tab. We are now ready to start!

### What are data apps?
An **app** (short for "application") is a computer program that provides an interface that allows users to input commands, and for the program to respond. Of course, that definition covers nearly all computer programs! But today the word "app" in general, refers to a program focussed on a particular task.

A **data app** is a type of app that is designed to work with data, allowing exploration of a dataset without requiring specific technical skills, and in generating visualisations. A data app can also be a **web app**, if it is deployed to the internet so that others can use it, usually through a web browser.

### Data apps in Python
Until recently, building data apps has required good knowledge of the core web programming languages - HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These languages are not commonly used in research or education, because they are not designed for computation or data-processing. As such, a gap has existed between those with general-purpose code skills (for example in Python, R, C++ etc) and those with web skills. To address this, libraries have been developed to bridge this gap between the "back end" (code that handles data management and computation) and the "front end" (code that generates the user interface, to be used without requiring technical skills).

In Python, a popular library for data app development is [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). This is a library which aims to make building data apps as streamlined as possible - and includes easy ways to deploy your app. Streamlit also integrates with some popular Python data visualisation libraries. Altogether, this means we can build good-looking, user-friendly dashboards, in pure Python!

### Goals
In this course, our goal is to create a data app using Streamlit to explore a dataset (in this case, of wine characteristics!). Along the way, we will learn
- the basics of the Streamlit API
- how to make "widgets", interactive parts of our app
- how to bring data into a dataframe, the core data format for Streamlit
- how to generate visualisations, aiding exploration of the data.
