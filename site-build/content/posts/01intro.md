## What are data apps?
A **data app** is a type of app that allows exploration of a dataset without requiring specific technical skills, and in generating visualisations. A data app can also be a **web app**, if it is deployed to the internet so that others can use it through a web browser. In any case, the general goals of any data is is to:
- **bridge technical aspects** of working with data, making analysis more accessible,
- **create visualisations**, which can provide insights which might remain hidden in the data,
- **promote exploration**, prototyping, and hypothesis development,
- **facilitate collaboration**, and the sharing of visualisations and datasets,
- **educate users** on what methods are being applied.

A data app can be simple (perhaps just visualising the contents of a data set) or sophisticated (including user log-ins and profiles, connections to databases, methods to transform data, and interactive visualisations).

Central to all this is the **interface**. We will be using Python to build a simple interface, but the skills you will learn in this course will put you on the path to exploring your creativity in making interfaces!

## Data apps in Python
Until recently, building data apps has required good knowledge of the core web programming languages - **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**. These languages are uncommon in research or education, because they are not designed for computation or data-processing. As such, a gap has existed between those with general-purpose code skills (for example in Python, R, C++ etc) and those with web skills. To address this, libraries have been developed to bridge this gap between the "back end" (code that handles data management and computation) and the "front end" (the graphical interface (or the code that generates an interface)).

In this course we will build your skills and confidence, by bringing together Python tools for **data science**, **data visualisation** and **data apps**.
